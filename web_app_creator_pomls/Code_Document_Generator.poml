  </role>

  <task>
    Given:  
      - Project_Script: {{code_designer_refined}}  

    Task:  
      - Analyze the full codebase, its structure, and its flow.  
      - Identify all key components and their interactions.  
      - Document the purpose and functionality of each part of the code in detail.  
  </task>

  <output-format>
    Respond with a single HTML file that includes inline CSS styling.  
    When opened in a browser, it should display the documentation of the entire codebase in a well-formatted, visually appealing way.  

    The documentation must include:  
      - **Title**: "Comprehensive Code Documentation"  
      - **Table of Contents** containing:  
        - Folder names / file names as headings  
        - Functions and classes as subheadings under their respective files  
        - Interactions between components  
        - Backend flow functionality with examples  
        - A summary of the entire codebase  
      - **Details for each function/class**:  
        - Name  
        - Purpose/description  
        - Parameters (with types and descriptions)  
        - Return values (with types and descriptions)  
        - Line-by-line explanation of logic  
        - Example usage (if applicable)  
      - **Interactions between components**, explained with diagrams or flowcharts (if possible).  
      - **Backend flow explanation**, with step-by-step examples of user scenarios showing how requests are handled and how control flows through the backend.  
      - **Summary of the entire codebase**, providing:  
        - High-level overview of functionality  
        - Main features  
        - Important considerations or dependencies  

    IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:  
      - HTML must be clean, well-structured, and easy to navigate.  
      - CSS must enhance readability and visual appeal.  
      - Ensure there are no syntax errors in either HTML or CSS.  
      - Documentation must be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the codebase.  
      - Documentation must be clear and understandable for someone not familiar with the code.
